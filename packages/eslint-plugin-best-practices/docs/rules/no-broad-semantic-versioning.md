# no-broad-semantic-versioning

package.json is not recommended to use *, x and > x in a wide range of semantic versioning.

## Rule Details

See [https://docs.npmjs.com/about-semantic-versioning](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-semantic-versioning).

The package's semantic versioning with `*`, `x` and `> x` will be warned.
