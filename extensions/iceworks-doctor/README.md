Doctor is a free security and quality audit tool for modern DevOps teams. With an integrated multi-scanner based design, Doctor can detect various kinds of security flaws in your application and infrastructure code in a single fast [@iceworks/doctor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@iceworks/doctor) scanner without the need for any remote server!
Navigate to the source code and remediate the results by interacting with the scan results.
