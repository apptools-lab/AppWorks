Iceworks is a Visual Intelligent Development Pack, provide visualization and intelligent technology to build Universal Application faster and better, support Web / H5 / MiniProgram Application.

## Features

### Visual Development

Iceworks Visual Development provides functions: Visual Construction and Visual Configuration.

Visual Construction provides the drag and drop capability of WYSIWYG, which helps to quickly complete the development of front-end pages.This capability is independent of the specific platform  and framework, after building, you can update UI by code. It greatly reduces the threshold of front-end development and improves the efficiency of front-end development. At the same time, it also takes into account the maintainability and flexibility of the program.

> See [UI Builder Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=iceworks-team.iceworks-ui-builder) for more details.

Visual Configuration aims to reduce the threshold of front-end development and improve the development experience. It provides the ability to generate code through process guidance and form operation. The ability supports user-defined templates or materials and provides developers with the ability to generate personalized code.

### Intelli Code

Iceworks Intelli Code currently provides functions: Code Completion and Code Information.

In the process of code writing, Iceworks Intelli Code can automatically predict the developer's programming intention and continuously recommend "the next code to be written" to the developer. The developer can directly confirm the code to be input by "one click completion", thus greatly improving the efficiency of code writing. For example, when inputting style fields and values, the Code Completion effect provided by Iceworks is as follows.

Iceworks Code Completion is based on semantic and code analysis, completely local execution, ensure code security; millisecond response, smooth coding!

### Quality and Efficiency

Iceworks provides two basic functions: Quality Check and Programming Timer.

Based on a large number of project practices, we have produced a quality evaluation model, which can generate quality reports for projects and provide methods to repair related quality problems.
Programming Timer measures developer's programming efficiency by automatically tracking developer's programming activities. It can help developers review their programming activities, generate programming efficiency reports and give relevant suggestions.
